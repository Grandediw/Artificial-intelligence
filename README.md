## 2. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
### Overview
The second assignment dives into probabilistic models and sequences using HMMs. Tasks include:
- Forward and Backward algorithms for probability calculations.
- Viterbi algorithm for finding the most probable state sequence.
- Parameter estimation with the Baum-Welch algorithm.

### Key Features
- Models time-series data effectively.
- Useful for speech recognition, bioinformatics, and other applications.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
### Overview
The third assignment focuses on implementing RL techniques to solve decision-making problems. Key topics include:
- Q-Learning and SARSA.
- Policy Gradient Methods.
- Exploration vs. Exploitation strategies.

### Key Features
- Simulates agent-environment interactions.
- Optimizes policies to maximize long-term rewards.
